## Quick Start
Scaffold a new Supercharge application on your computer using NPM:

```
npm init @supercharge/app@latest hello-supercharge
```

This will create a new Supercharge application in a `hello-supercharge` folder of your current working directory.


## About Supercharge
Supercharge is a full-stack Node.js framework — not just a web-framework.

Supercharge builds on top of the Koa HTTP framework. Supercharge refines all Koa handling by providing a streamlined approach to middlewares and routing. You’ll also benefit from a comprehensive application setup containing configuration and database management, logging, integrating with Objection.js and knex.js for a powerful database interaction.


## Learning
Supercharge has an extensive [documentation](https://superchargejs.com/docs) that gives you all the information to get started with the framework.
